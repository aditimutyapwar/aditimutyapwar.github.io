									<h1>FULLSTORY</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<h3>HighSchool and College</h3>
								<p>It was 2009 when I graduated from high school. And soon moved to Pune, India to pursue Electronics Engineering from Pune University. It was then when I realised my true interest lies in Science and I was confident about my decision. I had the best four years of my life and graduated in 2013 with decent grades. At least good enough to get me a job at Deloitte Consulting India during Campus Recruitment in College.</p>
								<h3>Work Experience</h3>
								<p>Since I always had my interests on the creative side of the world, knowing my love for photography, the only way to link my science knowledge with the creative world was to start learning <Strong>Front End Development</Strong>, and Deloitte is the place where I got a chance to train myself with top-notch employees in Technology who guided me, taught me and mentored me for 3 years to get hands-on in Frontend Development. I worked with numerous top American Clients like <Strong>TOMS shoes, Weight Watchers, EMC, Dell Inc., etc</Strong> to rebrand their websites or set up some of their customer portals. My Time in <Strong>Deloitte Digital</Strong> was most fruitful when I met the love of my life and then we got married in 2016. That is when we moved to Budapest, Hungary for his work-related deputation and deep heartedly I had to leave my job at Deloitte and start looking for a new one in Budapest, Hungary. Well, after some trials and brushing up my concepts, I got a job in <Strong>Morgan Stanley</Strong> as Senior Associate for a wonderful team of 10 who closely worked in creating reporting tools for Sales and Traders. The Finance domain was fairly new to me and I was excited to make the most of my opportunity to learn constantly in Morgan Stanley. Meanwhile, as my pet project, I even set up my <Strong>blogging website (www.mylenscape.com)</Strong> in Wordpress and continued to stay close to my creative side of the world.</p>
								<p>It was in 2019 when my husband was transferred to the US and I had to again leave my job as part of the relocation.</p>
								<p>Currently, I am located in Houston and seeking Full-time opportunity in Frontend Development. I love what I do and want to continue to grow by creating more seamless, mobile-first, user-friendly websites to make this world a better place!</p>
								<h3>Awards and Certifications</h3>
								<p>Received numerous <Strong>SPOT/APPLAUSE AWARDS in Deloitte</Strong> for excellent performance and value addition to the project.<br>
								Received multiple appreciations from <Strong>business stakeholders and Manager in Morgan Stanley</Strong> for understanding the business requirements and providing best possible solution.<br>
								<Strong>Udemy certified for Angular 8, React and Redux programming language</Strong></p>
								<h3>Personality</h3>
								<p>I am a <Strong>Creative, Detail Oriented, Problem Solver</Strong> who always tries to be positive in any given situation and I try my best to solve any problem as calmly as possible. If someone needs my help, I would always be there with a smile. I am a <Strong>team player</Strong> and I enjoy working with people who can communicate and create an open and welcoming environment. Also, I make sure if I am stuck or need some assistance at work I seek out for help without hesitation. Also, I am not afraid to give my honest opinion if asked. I am very <Strong>easy-going</Strong> and I actively try to remain curious to learn new things. If I make a mistake, I own up to it and work harder to fix it.</p>
								<h3>Hobbies</h3>
								<p>Photography, Badminton, Table-Tennis, Blogging</p>
